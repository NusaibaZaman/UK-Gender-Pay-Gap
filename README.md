**Data Source:** [https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download/)  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Excel

---

This project explores gender pay disparities across UK employers using the official 'Gender Pay Gap reporting dataset' from the UK Government.  
It analyses key metrics such as mean and median pay gaps, bonus differences, gender representation across pay quartiles, and year-on-year trends between 2020 and 2025.

The dataset is transformed and modelled in Power BI using a star schema, enabling insights by year, company size and sector.

## Summary
- The median hourly pay gap across reporting employers stays around 11 to 12%, which means women earn roughly 12% less than men on median hourly pay.  
- The mean pay gap is slightly higher at around 13%, this usually happens because men are more represented in the highest-paying roles, which skews the average.  
- The bonus pay gap remains quite volatile, but overall bonuses tend to widen the gender gap even further.  
- Looking at gender representation by pay quartile, women make up a smaller share in the top quartile, around 41% female and 59% male.
